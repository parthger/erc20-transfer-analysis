For automating the whole process daily 
Using a cron job or cloud scheduler(like AWS or Lambda) to run the python script daily at a particular time like 12:00 PM 
Automating data cleaning and analytics within the script, ensuring the statistics (e.g., user activity, correlations) are calculated dynamically.
Using pandas and Matpolislib to generate report in CSV file .
Then we can directly send the report daily or this also we can aumoate direclty using python's smtplib.
Major focus on the error handlings is must. setting up notification if the pileline fails

I have created a diagram of this and have shared in the zip file attached to the mail.
